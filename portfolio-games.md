Most of my work from the past several years has been professional stuff, but I've recently started working on games again in my spare time. Here's what I've completed or contributed to.

### Space Goose

</div>

<div><p><small>(Released October 28, 2025.)</small><br/> Perhaps my most complex <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a> game yet. Space Goose is a side-scrolling space shooter inspired by games like Vampire Survivors. It's available on itch.io using the widget above - you can play it right now!</p>

### Chirality

<div><p><small>(Released October 13, 2025.)</small><br/> It's your favorite block puzzle game! I wrote this over the course of a week (or so) mostly just to prove to myself I could finish a game project. It's written for <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a>, a "fantasy" 8-bit computer/console. I really appreciate the restrictions PICO-8 imposes - there is some truth to the idea that limitation breeds creativity.</p>

<small>(From 2008.)</small>

A 2D roguelike RPG inspired by Ultima, Diablo, and Dragon Quest (obviously). Dungeon Diver 2D was one of my first attempts at using the XNA Framework (RIP) to create a game. It originated long ago as a Windows Forms application as an assignment for a college class and evolved from there. It's obviously full of assets from other games (you can see my poor attempts at art here and there; there's a reason the term "programmer art" was coined), and as such I must say: **_this game and its source code are here for educational purposes only!_**

**Links removed as of Feb. 2017:** This game was unfinished and I never ended up finishing it, so I've taken it down.

### Animal Editor

</div>

A tile-based level editor for various 2D games. I wrote Animal Editor back in 2007 as a basic tool to construct levels for an action-platformer game I had in the works at the time. The core renderer was in native C++ (built atop a now-defunct framework called Haaf's Game Engine) and the UI was built entirely in C++/CLI. This was one of my first larger projects, written just after I finished High School.
