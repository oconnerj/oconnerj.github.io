Wow. Job boards across the internet are littered with ads for _full stack developers_. In fact, I'd wager a majority of positions listed in software development use that title somewhere within. It's all I see anymore, aside from _cloud architects_ and _site reliability engineers_. Whatever happened to Software Engineer I/II/III/Senior? I guess people are just too talented these days to relegate themselves to such simple titles.

With how in-demand these "full stack" folks are, they must be some of the highest paid roles in the industry, right? After all, a full stack developer is expected to have a very mature and well-rounded skillset that includes expertise in multiple domains. One must be as familiar with Angular as they are Entity Framework; as proficient in web sockets as they are Unix sockets. Let's take a peek at some of these job postings:

> Attn: full stack developers! Looking for insanely talented self-starters to join CorpCo, Inc. on our thrilling journey to mediocrity! Requirements:

Oh. Weirdâ€”the salary shown here seems very entry-level. Are you sure that's right? This one must be an outlier. Let's keep looking. 

Here's another one:

Gee, I dunno. I don't think I can pay my mortgage in Rockstar energy drinks. I guess I can call my lender...

Nope.

## What Does "Full Stack" Actually Mean?

Alright, enough jokes. Obviously you're here for my dry, droning prose full of perplexing vocabulary and stilted phrasing, not my humor. It's easy to poke fun at the over-the-top tone and often ridiculous/impossible requirements cited in the posts on these job boards. Honestly, though, they're usually written by recruiters that don't know any better or middle managers hoping to land a unicorn (not realizing it's a huge turn-off for most of them). I've got sympathy for those folks. I don't have any sympathy for whomever is demanding all developers be "full stack". 

Here's the thing: you might think that a full stack dev is supposed to be a sort of jack-of-all-trades. As in, they've got a wide spread of skills, but not much depth in any of them. On paper, that's kind of the intention. Companies that seek out full stack engineers are specifically looking for folks that can fill any role at any time. It only makes sense, as an employer, to have as much flexibility in your workforce as possible. That way, if something unexpected comes up, you're not left scrambling to hire someone to solve it. 

In practice, what I've seen happen instead is that fewer devs get tasked with _all the roles_ for a project. Since each person is supposedly capable of handling any task, project managers assume fewer people are needed overall. Tasks are assigned without regard for a person's focus. Expertise goes out the window, so all modules are written at the junior level.
