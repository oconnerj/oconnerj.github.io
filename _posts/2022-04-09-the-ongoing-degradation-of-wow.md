World of Warcraft is a game near and dear to my heart. Obviously, right? Half the articles on this site are about it. But seriously, I grew up loving Blizzard games. Diablo and Diablo II are forever etched in my mind—less memories and more experiences, like riding your first rollercoaster. Starcraft was one of the first RTS games I ever played; while I was never very good at it, both its campaign and LAN multiplayer make up a significant portion of my wasted teenage summers. Warcraft III was the same: a formative adventure, placed on the same mental shelf as classics like Half-Life and Baldur's Gate. I was one of those kids turned adults who believed Blizzard could do no wrong, and World of Warcraft only amplified my faith.

The game, for me, was monumental. It was everything I enjoyed about EverQuest back in 1999 but with that signature Blizzard polish, flair, and personality that drew me into their other games. Somehow, it felt familiar. Flavors of Diablo II mixed with the rich core of exploration and discovery imported from other MMOs. I remember leveling in Stranglethorn Vale on my Paladin while simultaneously trying to finish homework due the next day, reading assigned books while on flight paths between zones, and playing until 1 or 2 AM despite having to be at school by 7.

I never hit the level cap in the original "vanilla" game. I got a late start, and by the time I understood the game well enough to get there, I went off to college and couldn't afford the subscription fee for a while. As is true for many players, however, I kept up with the game through its expansions. I have purchased and played, for some length of time, every WoW expansion that has ever been released. At minimum, I've completed the "main quest" (so much as older expansions had such a thing) and dabbled in the end game of all of them. Over the last 17 years, I have grown up playing World of Warcraft.

## You Either Die a Hero...
Unfortunately, this game, which I once deeply enjoyed and honestly cared for—a beloved hallmark of my adolescence and young adulthood—has fallen into shambles. It's a shadow of its former self; a hollowed-out corpse occupied by some insidious creature puppeteering it from within. Is that too dramatic? Okay, fine. More bluntly: the game sucks now, and debatably, it has for at least 7 years. But **why**? How is it that a company as wealthy and influential as Blizzard can fail on the most basic levels for so long?

Sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself. As with many long-running serialized media properties, perhaps Game of Thrones as the most famous example, WoW didn't start sucking overnight. Its decline can, in hindsight, be tracked by a series of bad decisions. Often those decisions were in service of making the game better for players. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, as they say. Other times, the motivation was clearly greed. Here's a sampling of what I consider to be some of the more egregious missteps:

* Level boosts (_introduced in Mists_)
* Cash shop mounts (_Wrath_)
* Psychological manipulation of players to spend more money than just their sub fee (_started in Wrath, went off the rails in Mists_)
* The degradation and eventual dissolution of server community (_started in Wrath, culminated in Warlords_)
* The abandonment of pre-endgame content (_debatably began in Burning Crusade, but truly took root in Warlords_)
* A focus on seasonal disposable content (_Wrath, Cataclysm_)
* Overly streamlining content and gameplay (_gradual over time_)
* Endgame designed around complex, one-off systems which grant large amounts of temporary power, stripped from you at the start of the next expansion (_Legion_)
* A story and plot which are convoluted, contrived, and unsatisfying for players (_Warlords_)
* Repeated level and item squishes which have made the game inscrutable for newcomers and returning players alike (_Warlords_)
* Increasingly buggy releases and player-hostile systems, with serious defects and balance issues sitting for months until the major patches iterate on them (_Battle for Azeroth_)

Obviously, some of these assertions are debatable, but if you're familiar with the timeline of WoW's expansion releases, you'll see a clear progression in the list above. I'd say that over the course of the 8 years between Wrath of the Lich King and Legion, the developers made an ongoing series of poor decisions which eventually compromised the game. Warlords of Draenor in particular was a turning point. It was evident that something changed within Blizzard around this time.

Legion, while being widely praised, heralded the new era of Warcraft. Battle for Azeroth continued the direction and Shadowlands has doubled down on many of the worst elements, especially when it comes to the plot and lore. _Now_ we're finally ready to ask: how can Blizzard keep missing the mark on these expansions? Why does it let its flagship game continue to fade into obscurity as just another hacky MMO desperately clinging onto players' wallets?

## The Soda Hypothesis

Perhaps the most important idea I can convey to you, dear reader, is this: Blizzard is a billion dollar company, and its parent entity Activision-Blizzard is a multi-billion dollar giant. If you're a smarty, you've already caught on to where I'm going with this, but if not, hang on—it's gonna get heady.

You see, as a multi-billion dollar industry titan with nearly infinite resources and (supposedly) some of the best game developers in the world at its disposal, Activision-Blizzard begins to approach godlike levels of capability. It _could_ do anything. Philosophers have asked of God for thousands of years: "if God is almighty, why does he allow suffering?" With Activision-Blizzard, you should be asking: "if it has so much money and power, why does the game suck?" And just like with God, you're asking the wrong question. You've presumed that the objective of God is to prevent suffering, and with Blizzard, **you've presumed that the goal is to make a good game**.

You might be surprised to hear that as a multi-billion dollar company, Activision-Blizzard is very interested in continuing to make even more money. To some degree all companies exist to make money, but I'd wager these super goliaths become what they are because they are laser-focused on making the most money in the most optimal way possible. This focus doesn't just _trickle_ down to subsidiaries—it **torrents** down upon them in the form of revenue goals, KPIs, tightly optimized financials, risk management strategies, and careful investments both externally and internally.

</div>

So where does an entity like this spend its capital? For one, on research into ways to make even more money. Let's look at a different business as an example. When the product is soft drinks—you know, like Coca-Cola, whose company board includes Bobby Kotick, CEO of Activision-Blizzard—the research is how to make them more addictive, more attractive, and cheaper to produce while minimizing consumer rejection. If you object to the term "addictive" being used in reference to a soda, let me remind you that [this is not a new](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html) or [controversial idea](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/coca-cola-false-advertising-unhealthy-drinks).

As it turns out, when the business is games, the objectives aren't much different. Make them more addictive and manipulative, lower the barrier to entry as far as possible, and—once you've got the player hooked—make the product cheaper to produce while minimizing rejection. This cycle is often referred to in industry parlance as _engagement_. The primary KPI for games today is engagement, as ongoing engagement creates more opportunities to extract additional revenue from existing players.

World of Warcraft has become a carefully-formulated soda, the result of many years of research and the expertise of several highly-paid and highly-talented designers. Their goals and incentives don't _necessarily_ line up with what makes a "good" game. They are tasked with making a game you keep playing and keep spending money on. Fun helps, but is optional... and all too often, subjective.

Actions, as always, speak louder than words. We must only look at the actions taken by the developers over the past several years to see their intent:

* The product is made to inspire engagement through time-gated systems, logarithmic game design, subscription term bonuses, and daily/weekly chores.
* It is made more attractive by: 
    - a pulpy, emotional, shallow (but easy to grasp at a high-level) plot focusing almost entirely on characters you've likely already formed an attachment to
    - highly polished visuals and cinematics
    - an echelon of content to strive for which is outside the casual reach
    - a rock bottom barrier to entry, allowing anyone to get into the newest content instantly (for a price)
    - and repeatable, instantly gratifying rewards systems.
* It has become cheaper to produce by slashing the size of the team creating it, testing it, maintaining it, and providing support for it.
* Consumer rejection is minimized by seasonal refreshes which keep players coming back for fresh content. 
    - Conveniently, these refreshes reset the logarithmic game design curve so that players can get endorphins from a new rush of advancement before, once again, hitting diminishing returns.
    - In a similar vein, the company follows an expansion-long cycle of promising to fix the problems introduced by the initial release. This cycle has existed in its current form since _Legion_, and has shown great success in convincing players to return for each major patch.

Together, these actions have allowed Blizzard to boost metrics and keep costs down, which keeps the financial folks at Activision-Blizzard happy and wealthy.

## Blizzard vs. Blizzard 

So what the hell happened to the Blizzard that I used to admire? A lot of people cite the acquisition of Blizzard by Activision as a major factor in the game's changing direction. Perhaps they're correct, to some degree, but to be clear: it's not like Bobby Kotick walked into the Blizzard offices in 2008 and yelled "from now on you're going to make all your games suck!" I mean, hell, maybe he did—the dude is so wealthy [he can just get away with threatening to kill people](https://www.businessinsider.com/activision-ceo-bobby-kotick-reportedly-threatened-former-assistant-killed-2021-11#:~:text=In%202006%2C%20Activision%20CEO%20Bobby,email%20to%20Insider%20that%20%22Mr.). But it doesn't matter, because Kotick himself wasn't the problem. Not at first, anyway. No, the problem is sadly much more systematic than any one man.

Only with the benefit of hindsight can we look at the slow trickle of talent from Blizzard over the years and understand what likely was happening. For a long time, players of the games could sense the internal struggle. The artists, designers, and engineers that had crafted the franchises we loved left the company. Changes which seemed to affront the core design philosophy of the games started to accumulate. The games industry was changing, embracing a new revenue stream players were being conditioned to accept: [recurrent player spending](https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/8/16623052/take-two-recurrent-consumer-spending-microtransactions-gta-online). From [horse armor](https://screenrant.com/oblivion-horse-armor-dlc-controversy-explained/) to [loot boxes](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/08/26/star-wars-battlefront-2-loot-box-controversy-we-hit-rock-bottom-ea-dice-says), developers and publishers were exploring ways to grow the industry. Many of the remaining old guard were likely asked to "adapt to the times".

The rest of them, it seems, were probably busy sexually harassing female coworkers, drinking on the job, and contributing to one of the most toxic game development workspaces we have the displeasure of knowing about. I started writing this article before all the news broke about the lawsuit against Activision-Blizzard by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (yes, _that long ago_). Reading about it, and all the stories, further lawsuits, pathetic statements, and union-busting that have come out since the initial explosive report has only served to reinforce my assessment: Blizzard Entertainment is dead.

However, Blizzard is just an extreme and volatile instance of a phenomenon which affects every industry as it grows beyond natural sustainability. To go back to the Coca-Cola example, at some point you have saturated the market. For the most part, everyone who would want to drink Coke is drinking it. Sure, there are small battlefields where you might win some market share back from Pepsi or lose some ground to them, but the inevitability of products as wildly successful as these is that you will run out of customers. Organic forces such as health-conscious movements, increased availability of alternative products (e.g. drinking coconut water instead of a soda), and general brand numbness are all that's left, slowly eroding your profits. If there's one thing you should know about financial people, it's that **their entire reason for existing is to make the line go up, every quarter, forever.** When that line starts going down... well, they start taking more drastic measures.

How do you grow a product or a business which has peaked? One strategy is diversification. Coca-Cola and Pepsi both own an _insane_ number of companies, some of which you would never expect. For example, did you know Coke owns Costa Coffee? Oh, you knew that one. How about Columbia Pictures? You know, the film studio. No, they don't own it anymore, but for a brief period in the 80's they did, and when they sold it to Sony in 1989, they made a healthy [$1.5 billion dollar profit](https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1997/10/13/232494/index.htm) (**$3.4 billion**, adjusted for inflation). Pepsi is even crazier; while Coke mostly owns beverage companies, PepsiCo owns Frito-Lay. That's right: [Cheetos are a Pepsi product](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/122215/top-5-companies-owned-pepsi-pep.asp).

As it turns out, Activision-Blizzard dabbled in diversification as well, into the mobile market. In 2016 they purchased King for nearly $6 billion. They own several other studios: Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer Games, Toys for Bob, Treyarch, Vicarious Visions (recently dissolved into Blizzard). ...
