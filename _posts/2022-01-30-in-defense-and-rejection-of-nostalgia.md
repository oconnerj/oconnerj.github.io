excerpt: "What if nostalgia isn't necessarily a weakness, as it's often framed, but instead a reaction to the direction of culture?"

You know, nostalgia gets a bad rap. "Move on," people say. "Things now are better than they were. You think you do [want old stuff], [but you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Wrw3c2NjeE). You're just wearing rose-tinted glasses hiding the flaws of all those things you used to enjoy." Kind of like obesity, nostalgia is one of those things afflicting millions which get attributed to personal weakness or lack of discipline. Being nostalgic is childish, right? It's yearning for a time which has passed, for a zeitgeist long extinct, and for a world long since moved on.

Frankly, I see the point. I don't miss VHS tapes getting eaten by a screwy VCR, or having to wait for them to rewind. I don't miss internet speeds measured in bits per second rather than megabits. I don't miss the Cold War. I don't miss the times when various diseases were death sentences which are now manageable or even curable. Culture, society, science, technology—we've made so many amazing advancements in innumerable areas that we have the amazing luxury of getting to take for granted today. 

Yet it's strange. I actually do miss the era before streaming video services had completely taken over and then fractured, leaving my ability to access media completely in the whims of myriad Hollywood execs. I fondly recall that window where the barrier of entry to the Internet was high enough that it couldn't feasibly be a massive advertising duopoly transforming misinformation into profit. I long for the time before Americans had largely forgotten what it means to be "one nation, indivisible." And, of course, I'd love to cherry pick a time before pharmaceutical companies charged $400 per vial for insulin.

## The Argument for Nostalgia

I'm certain this is not a new idea—there are probably entire areas of psychological study dedicated to nostalgia—but I would wager that a nostalgic reaction is not always, or in fact even _often_, an overfondness of the past. At least, not in the surface-level emotional way most people colloquially use the term. I think it's fair to say that nostalgia is frequently a manifestation of unhappiness with the state and direction of culture, entertainment, or even society itself.

Before we proceed, let me be clear on the term _nostalgia_ in the context of this article. There are, to me, two definitions of nostalgia which refer to related, but slightly different, phenomena. First is nostalgia in the same vein as déjà vu: a reflexive feeling one experiences circumstantially, evoking the wistful and sentimental aspects referenced in e.g. the [Merriam-Webster definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nostalgia) of the word. In this post, however, I want to focus on something more specific: the desire to evoke that feeling intentionally.

As a feeling, nostalgia might seem unattractive on the surface. For many, it carries a tinge of melancholy and ennui. If you ask some folks, though, it's a prideful or satisfied remembrance of things that _were_ instead of a somber reflection on how things _are_ in contrast. This, to me, is key to understanding the self-infliction of it, because these interpretations are two sides of the same coin. Those who seek nostalgia are hoping to feel some combination of sentimental reflection and wistful comfort in the way things used to be as a coping mechanism against the way things are today. To put it another way, many of those who indulge in nostalgia are using it to process the trauma of living in the modern world.

## Nostalgia as a Vice?

Of course there are those who take their nostalgia too far. Some folks will get lost in the past, losing sight of the real world and creating a sort of fantasy for themselves, a recreation of their ideal world which never existed, whose scale and scope depends on financial constraints more than self-restraint. Overuse of coping mechanisms is a problem for all types of them—some people drink too much, some folks spend every non-working hour in an MMO, and others drown themselves in nostalgia. This cannot be held against nostalgia exclusively unless one is willing to start moralizing all coping mechanisms, and I suspect that's a glass house which can't withstand too many stones.

It could, perhaps, be argued that nostalgia is particularly strong in contrast to similar feelings. An innate emotional reaction with strong psychological effects which can be triggered simply by exposing oneself to the correct stimuli is indeed powerful. This is a double-edged sword; it's accessible <small>(_for the most part_, though hyper-monetizing nostalgic media such as movies, music, and games is becoming very common)</small>, effective, and in most cases harmless. But it's also addictive in the same way people can literally [become addicted to misery](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/where-science-meets-the-steps/201403/are-you-addicted-unhappiness). It's an unfortunate truth that most of us have some kind of vice—I imagine immersing oneself in nostalgia is probably healthier than snorting coke, though self-destructive behavior of any kind is still a problem.

Perhaps that's the only important takeaway here: nostalgia is often referred to as a weakness, an immaturity, or a refusal to let go. I think, for those seeking it out, it's just like any other hobby, legal vice, or habit. It has its positives and potential negatives, but often it's a reactionary defense created to help shield the seeker from some kind of distress (in the scientific sense).

## Responding to Change

In my examples earlier, I made the point that while I don't miss something as inconvenient as rewinding VHS tapes, I _do_ miss what those tapes represent for me. They're emblematic of a time before the very concept of _ownership_ was being eroded. When you owned a VHS tape of Star Wars, you **owned** it. You could watch it over and over, on your own terms, so long as you had a working TV, VCR, and tape. DVDs were largely the same, but Blu-Rays started introducing draconian DRM schemes which often made it challenging to watch the movie without a stable internet connection or a new enough player. Now, much of the media created in the past few years will likely never see a physical release at all, forever to be locked away behind a monthly subscription which will [keep going up in price](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884263/netflix-price-increases-2021-us-canada-all-plans-hd-4k) for the foreseeable future.

Humans love to boil complex ideas into straightforward black-and-white concepts. Back in our earliest days as a species, this trait kept us going and pushing forward even in the absence of a complete understanding. However, a great deal of what we experience as sentient creatures is the result of a massive, unpredictable cocktail of stimuli, synapses, and situations which all affect the outcome. The consequences of a single minor change to an environment can eventually result in catastrophic conditions capable of toppling empires. This, too, is a piece of the nostalgia puzzle. 

No one enjoyed rewinding VHS tapes, but the instant gratification and expanded capacity of DVDs made entertainment slightly less special; instead of watching a couple episodes of a TV show at a time, you could catch up on entire seasons with only a few disc swaps. With streaming, you can binge entire shows without ever leaving your couch. Combined with the crippling social media addictions many of us have, well... don't you often find yourself tuning out the show you were watching and just scrolling on your phone instead?

The graphics capabilities of the NES were objectively worse than later consoles, and everyone loves the amazing graphics in the latest games, but now the teams making those games have to invest so much time and money into them that they _must_ be designed with as much mass-market appeal as possible to recoup their costs. This leads to significantly less risk-taking and innovation in the space. Aren't you tired of companies making the same damn game, year after year, mimicking whatever the last decent innovation was? Do you notice those breaths of fresh air getting fewer and further between with every iteration?

Smart home devices are another example: to get the weather, you used to have to watch TV at the right time on the right channel for the forecast or read the newspaper. Now you can just ask the friendly little puck to tell it to you... so long as you're fine with it also listening to every word you ever say and storing that data to sell to advertisers. I kind of miss the days before every device in my house was spying on me with my own implicit consent.

## Rejection - In Both Senses

Nostalgia is a rejection of the consequences of what we're told is progress. It's intentionally putting oneself backwards in time in order to, just for a moment, escape the "dystopic future" it sometimes feels like we're in. It's immersing oneself in a context before all of the very real pressure being exerted on us, day in and day out, by the numbing manufactured serotonin hits of social media, the glamorous but soulless games full of psychologically-manipulating microeconomies designed to sell you loot boxes and skins, the dishonest Twitter performances of two-faced politicians getting rich and fat while the people are as divided as they've been since the Civil War, the flagrant fraud and grift of cryptocurrency and NFTs resulting in further untaxable wealth consolidation at the expense of gullible hopefuls just trying to escape the grind; the list goes on and on. Often, it's allowing oneself to mentally relax within a period of one's life that was, in some tangible or intangible way, "better" than it is now.

Truthfully, _that's_ the danger of nostalgia. It's not the feeling itself, nor the seeking of it, which is harmful. It's the retreating into the past and giving up on the **now**. Responsible nostalgia is healthy escapism, but too often nostalgia becomes an excuse to not try and make things better today. It's easier to just wistfully look backward than to sternly march forward, even though the things we want from the past could, theoretically, exist today in harmony with the very real progress we've made. We've just got to fight for it ourselves rather than wish for a golden time that never actually existed.

## So, Wait... Are You Pro- or Anti-Nostalgia?

Nostalgia is a symptom that something is wrong. Things will never be perfect, and therefore nostalgia will always exist. As creatures, we humans love to focus on the negatives of today and the positives of yesterday. However, I propose that an _abundance_ of it is a much stronger indicator that perhaps something really is fundamentally damaged in society. Like with Neo in The Matrix, it's a sensation you feel almost subconsciously; a reaction to a stimulus you weren't even actively aware of. My point is simple: you can either be Neo, escaping the Matrix to fight for a better real world; or you can be Cypher, longing so hard for the memory of what used to be that you'd do anything to have it back.

This is where I arrived after reflecting on my own nostalgia. I've spent far too much money on 30 year old video games and systems, dusty old computers, movies from my childhood recorded to a format so outdated they might as well be etched in stone, and even ancient keyboards from "the good old days." You know, since they don't build 'em like they used to <small>(but [that one's kind of true](https://justinoconner.me/blog/2017/03/06/keyboard-review-unicomp-ultra-classic.html)... shh, don't tell anybody)</small>. I even bought a 50-pound hunk of glass, plastic, and analog electronics they used to call a _CRT TV_—look it up in your history books next to the dinosaurs. And while I will continue to indulge in my escapism from time to time, I recognize that there is a line, across which lies a dangerous place full of comfortable wistfulness I could wallow in for the rest of my life. 

So. Is nostalgia dangerous? Probably not. Is it healthy? Probably not either. Do what you want—what do I know, anyway? I'm just some dude on the internet.
