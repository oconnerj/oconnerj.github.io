excerpt: "What if nostalgia isn't a weakness, as it's often framed, but instead a response to the direction of culture?"

You know, nostalgia gets a bad rap. "Move on," people say. "Things now are better than they were. You think you do [want old stuff], but you don't. You're just wearing rose-tinted glasses hiding the flaws of all those things you used to enjoy." Kind of like obesity, nostalgia is one of those things afflicting millions which get attributed to personal weakness or lack of discipline. Being nostalgic is childish, right? It's yearning for a time which has passed, for a context long extinct, and for a world long gone.

Frankly, there are tons of situations where I agree with that sentiment 100%. I don't miss VHS tapes getting eaten by a screwy VCR, or having to rewind them slowly. I don't miss internet speeds measured in bits per second rather than megabits. I don't miss the Cold War. I don't miss the times when various diseases were death sentences which are now manageable or even curable. Culture, society, science, technology—we've made so many amazing advancements in innumerable areas that we have the amazing luxury of getting to take for granted today. 

Yet it's strange. I actually do miss the era before streaming video services had completely taken over and then fractured, leaving my ability to access media completely in the hands of the whims of various Hollywood execs. I miss that window where the barrier to entry onto the Internet was high enough that it wasn't feasible for it to be a massive marketing duopoly transforming misinformation into profit. I miss the time before Americans had largely forgotten what it means to be "one nation, indivisible." And, of course, I miss the days before pharmaceutical companies charged $400 per vial for insulin.

## The Argument for Nostalgia

I'm certain this is not a new idea—there are probably entire areas of sociological study dedicated to nostalgia—but I would wager that a nostalgic reaction is not always, or in fact even _often_, an overfondness of the past. At least, not in the surface-level emotional way most people colloquially use the term. I think it's fair to say that nostalgia is frequently a manifestation of unhappiness with the state and direction of culture, entertainment, or even society itself.

Before we proceed, let me be clear on the term _nostalgia_ in the context of this article. There are, to me, two definitions of nostalgia which refer to related, but slightly different, phenomena. First is nostalgia in the same vein as déjà vu: a reflexive feeling one experiences circumstantially, evoking the wistful and sentimental aspects referenced in e.g. the [Merriam-Webster definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nostalgia) of the word. In this post, however, I want to focus on the second form: the desire to evoke that feeling intentionally.

Why would one intentionally want to evoke the feeling of nostalgia? It often brings an element of melancholy, right? Yes, it's true: nostalgia can hit very hard and raise very powerful emotions. If you ask some folks, though, it's a prideful or satisfied remembrance of things that _were_ instead of a somber reflection on how things _are_ in contrast. This, to me, is the key to understanding the self-infliction of the feeling, because these interpretations are two sides of the same coin. Those who seek nostalgia are hoping to feel some combination of sentimental reflection and wistful comfort in the way things used to be as a coping mechanism against the way things are today. To put it another way, many of those who indulge in nostalgia are using it to process the trauma of living in the modern world.

## The Dangers of Coping

Of course there are those who take their nostalgia too far. Some folks will get lost in the past, losing sight of the real world and creating a sort of fantasy for themselves, a recreation of their ideal world whose scale and scope depends on financial constraints more than self-restraint. Overuse of coping mechanisms is a problem for all types of them—some people drink too much, some folks spend every non-working hour in an MMO, and others drown themselves in nostalgia. This cannot be held against nostalgia exclusively unless one is willing to start moralizing all coping mechanisms, and I suspect that's a glass house which can't sustain too many stones.

It could be argued that nostalgia is particularly strong. An innate emotional reaction with strong psychological effects which can be triggered simply by exposing oneself to the correct stimuli is indeed powerful. This is a double-edged sword; it's accessible <small>(_for the most part_, though hyper-monetizing nostalgic media such as movies, music, and games is becoming very common)</small>, effective, and in most cases harmless. But it's also addictive in the same way people can literally [become addicted to misery](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/where-science-meets-the-steps/201403/are-you-addicted-unhappiness). It's an unfortunate truth that most people have some kind of vice—I imagine immersing oneself in nostalgia is probably healthier than snorting coke, though self-destructive behavior in any manifestation is still a problem.

Perhaps that's the only important takeaway here: nostalgia is often referred to as a weakness, an immaturity, or a refusal to let go. I think, for those seeking it out, it's just like any other hobby, legal vice, or habit. It has its positives and potential negatives, but often it's a reactionary defense created to help shield the seeker from some kind of distress (in the scientific sense).

## Responding to Change

In my examples earlier, I made the point that while I don't miss something as inconvenient as rewinding VHS tapes, I _do_ miss what they represent for me. They're emblematic of a time before the very concept of _ownership_ of entertainment media was being eroded. When you owned a VHS tape of Star Wars, you owned it and could watch it so long as you had a working TV, VCR, and tape. DVDs were largely the same, but Blu-Rays started introducing draconian DRM schemes which often made it challenging to watch the movie without a stable internet connection or a new enough player. Now, much of the media created in the past few years will never see a physical release at all, forever to be locked away behind a monthly subscription which will [keep going up in price](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884263/netflix-price-increases-2021-us-canada-all-plans-hd-4k) for the foreseeable future. Star Wars is a particularly poignant example because the version available on Disney+ is a version which was changed by Lucasfilm multiple times after its original release. ...
