### D&D/Pathfinder-related Documents

You are free to use these rules in your own private games; however, if you plan on utilizing them in any other way please contact me.

#### Pathfinder Epic Classes

In my tenure as a GM over a long-running Pathfinder game, I found my players eventually going into levels beyond 20. For a long time there was no official ruleset for handling epic levels in Pathfinder. The Mythic Handbook is still the closest thing Pathfinder has to "epic" rules unless you utilize D&D's Epic Level Handbook. However, I don't feel like the Epic Level Handbook really fits the spirit of high-level Pathfinder play, so I wrote up a custom set of prestige classes to be utilized by my players beyond level 20.

I have posted these classes (and my other rules) [here on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yMtdkSsGtj_-oNhTmcVpdUVfr8rVO8ofUFD6CbqyM-E/edit?usp=sharing). I also created a [set of tables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xe6ectxHBRzNYyQIDxCQVWHDweZwvuajiQH3aL0X_nI/edit?usp=sharing) for Epic XP requirements for levels 21-40, which you might find useful if you're trying to run an epic-level Pathfinder game.

#### Statistics for Azathoth

As a challenge to myself to see if I could use Pathfinder's Mythic rules appropriately, I designed a mythic-class monster for my party to face. I chose Azathoth, a shapeless mass of pure chaos that the players had encountered a few times due to planar mishaps during high-level play. For the most part, I designed Azathoth by the book and tried to balance the encounter for a party of six 20th-level Pathfinder characters. (If you didn't know, 20th-level Pathfinder characters are insanely powerful, especially in a medium- or high-magic campaign setting.)

The stats for Azathoth are available [here on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g6QEtZ6TqBqtENPTMRIAJtdoou6-bMFDNvnk4edE9sY/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Statistics for Demogorgon

In my latest campaign, Demogorgon was the ruler of the entire Abyss and the end goal for the players was to defeat him. None of the stats I was able to find for him really "clicked" with me, so I drew up my own with inspiration from several other sources. Unlike Azathoth, Demogorgon does _not_ strictly follow Pathfinder's monster-building rules.

You can find the stats [here on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WVBTGX1mOWpyLxQ0MZq0-yhrOje1ZONuoasd4aj3KPo/edit?usp=sharing).
